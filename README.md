# _EZ2Home_
#### Home Automation is CoolðŸ¤©! But it's ExpansiveðŸ¥². 
#### EZ2Home enables you to automate your Home using basic hardware that costs under â‚¹600/room.ðŸ¤‘



## Overview
EZ2Home is a Home Automation System that can be used to control Home Appliances over Internet or Home Wi-Fi network. 
The Hadware requirement is only ESP module and Relays and you can automate your home.
Here we will use APIs to connect to the microcontrollers and appliances are attached to that microcontroller can be 
controlled directly from the site with just a click.

#### How it works
Our project has a main page which contain all the rooms that can be controlled by the microprocessors.

Each room has their own page to show the available appliances that can be controlled from the buttons.

If the appliances button is green it means the appliance is ON and if it's grey it means the appliance is OFF.
